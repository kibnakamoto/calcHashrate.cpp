# calcHashrate.cpp
NOTE: this isn't accurate. But power affects output by a lot.

This code is mostly experimental and for learning.

IMPORTANT: This code will not work unless you go to http://www.zedwood.com/article/cpp-sha256-function and copy paste the sha256 algorithm or find another module where sha256 is defined.

All the hashrate calculators I made (in c#, c++ and python) are hashing random bytes, you can edit how many bytes you want to hash. Meaning,the amount of bytes in a cryptocurrency's block is what should be inside the bytearray.
